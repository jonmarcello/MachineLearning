# MachineLearning
My first attempt at machine learning

## Description
This is an the repo I used to try to understand how libraries such as TensorFlow work.

This project doesn't use any external libraries other than numpy to create a basic neural network.

Both `network.py` and `neural_net.py` are individual of each other and can be run completely separately.
